FSharpML a thin API to explore ML.Net in F#
===========================================

FSharpML is a lightweight API writen in F# on top of the powerful machine learning framework [ML.Net](http://dot.net/ml) library. It is designed to enable users to explore ML.Net in a scriptable manner and maintaining the functional style of F#.

FSharpML is still in an experimental stage, but a nuget package is already available.
After installing the package via Nuget we can load the delivered reference script and start using ML.Net in conjunction with FSharpML.

We are planing to port all samples from the official site [Samples for ML.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples) within the comming days.
Current state is available [here](https://csbiology.github.io/FSharpML/).
